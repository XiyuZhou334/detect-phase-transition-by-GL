# Implementation:Detecting phase transition from data using generative learning
This repository hosts the generative approach that accurately identifies phase transitions using only system snapshots. Leveraging Variational Autoregressive Networks (VANs) for density estimation, an indicator is calculated to monitor the intrinsic sensitivity of the probability distribution to tuning parameters.
# Repository Contents

## data_plot.py
This tool encapsulates commonly used drawing logic and is used to directly generate the variation diagram of the indicator with tuning parameters

## indictor_calculation.py
This file is used to calculate the indictor for detecting phase transitions using generative learning method, provided that the obtained density estimation data needs to be loaded in advance

## main.py
This document provides the code for the VAN model as well as the training process of density estimation using the VAN model (including the loss function).  Specifically, the raw configurations generated by numerical simulations are adopted as input to train the VAN model, thereby acquiring the network parameters.
