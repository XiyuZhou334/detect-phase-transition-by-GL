# Implementation: Detecting phase transition from data using generative learning
This repository hosts the generative approach that accurately identifies phase transitions using only system snapshots. Leveraging Variational Autoregressive Networks (VANs) for density estimation, an indicator is calculated to monitor the intrinsic sensitivity of the probability distribution to tuning parameters.

## data_plot.py
This tool encapsulates commonly used drawing logic and is used to directly generate the variation diagram of the indicator with tuning parameters. Upon loading the control parameters and indicator values, it can straightforwardly produce the variation relationship plot between the two, thereby enabling the analysis of phase boundary positions.

## indictor_calculation.py
This file is designed to calculate the specific indicator employed for detecting phase transitions using generative learning method. Upon loading the logarithmic probabilities of configurations generated by VAN, it accumulates the absolute values of changes in logarithmic probabilities between adjacent parameter points.

## main.py
This document provides the code for the VAN model as well as the training process of density estimation using the VAN model (including the loss function). Specifically, the raw configurations generated by numerical simulations are adopted as input to train the VAN model, thereby acquiring the network parameters. By loading the pre-trained VAN network parameter file, the normalized probabilities of configurations can be directly generated. Hyperparameters: L denotes the system size, kernel represents the size of the convolutional kernel, the learning rate is generally set to the range of 0.0001 to 0.001, and the batch_size is typically 1000. The Adam optimizer is employed to minimize the objective function.
